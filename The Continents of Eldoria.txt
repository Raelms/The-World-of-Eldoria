The Continents of Eldoria

A world vast, ancient, and bleeding with forgotten truths.

Aurelith – The Crown of Ash and Empire
The heartland of the Aurelian Empire, where sprawling cities rise from soil soaked in blood and ash. Long ago fertile and green, now its plains are greyed by endless war and magical exploitation. Human nobles rule through veiled threats, marriages forged like iron chains, and coin that stinks of slavery. The Black Rift—a scar across the land—whispers secrets to sorcerers desperate enough to listen. Below, the Dwarves retreat further into their stone keeps, their great engines slowing with each generation.

Aurelith is rich, arrogant, and constantly cannibalizing its own history to feed its future.

Sylvaran – The Verdant Haunt
Massive trees tower over all life in Sylvaran, their roots as old as gods and twice as silent. Elven cities are grown into the branches, while the forest floor is sacred and dangerous. The land is alive—sentient groves devour trespassers, and the wind carries whispers of ancient betrayals. The Fae's Everwild pulses between here and elsewhere, barely tethered to reality. Myrrkin vaults sit hidden beneath crystal-strewn hills, humming in tune with the world’s ley lines, waiting for anyone foolish enough to trespass.

Beauty reigns here, but it does not forgive.

Zan’Khara – The Burning Exile
Endless dunes and obsidian cliffs shape this desert realm, carved not just by wind but by forgotten wrath. Lamian temples rise from red stone, each one a hymn to gods who answer only in dreams. Their queens rule with prophecy, venom, and fire-wrought magic. The Korrin roam the ashlands in ritual-bound caravans, birthing flame-born warriors in pits of sacred magma. Rumors speak of demons trading spells and flesh in the night markets beneath the sand.

Here, survival is law, and mercy is considered weakness.

Noctherion – The Shattered Veil
Perpetual dusk stains the sky above Noctherion, a realm where sunlight feels like a half-forgotten myth. Cities of the Umbrathi flicker between shadow and form, their spires visible only when the moon weeps. Deep forests twist space itself—some who enter never return, others emerge changed, speaking in dead tongues. The Obsidian Monastery houses monks with sewn eyes, who chant prophecies that make demons flinch. The dead do not rest here—they walk, they whisper, and they wait.

This land remembers things no one dares to speak aloud.

Thalassor – The Drowned Archive
Far beneath the crashing waves lies Thal’mora, a kingdom of bioluminescent spires and ancient silence. The Nymari dwell here, guarding relics etched with truths older than time. Sunken ruins dot the seabed—fragments of failed invasions from the surface, now rotting under coral and curse. Those who dive deep enough hear the ocean sing in voices that aren’t theirs. Some never resurface. Others resurface different.

The sea does not share its secrets; it absorbs them.

Drakenvaal – The Cradle of Fire and Flight
Mountains cleave the sky across Drakenvaal, their peaks crowned with thunderclouds and floating islands. Dragons rule from within fire-lit caves and lightning-split skies. Their hoards aren’t just gold—but knowledge, bones, and broken oaths. The Dragonette walk among dragons, half-beast, half-legend, torn between two worlds. Wyrmduels crack the heavens open, and judgment is dealt in flame. To trespass here is to wake something ancient—and proud.

Drakenvaal bows only to power, and respects only legacy.

Skyrend – The Stormwound Expanse
Chains of sky-islands drift across the skies of Skyrend, anchored to stormclouds that never part. The Volari fly from citadel to citadel, wind-guided and free, yet forever hunted by the fall. Below lie the shattered remains of cities that could not hold their altitude. The ground here is cursed, the air is alive, and the thunder sings in mourning. Every Volari child is taught: the sky gives, but it does not protect.

They are the last dreamers of the open air.

Tarn-Krag – The Wild Wound
This land was broken long before the first axe or sword. Giant bones jut from hills like monuments, and fire rains unpredictably from the cracked sky. Beastkin and Orcs roam in warbands, driven not by bloodlust, but by the grim knowledge that peace has no place here. Gods were once born in this place—now only their hunger remains. Clans rise and fall like smoke, and every tribe carves its history into the skin of the dead.

There is no law in Tarn-Krag, only memory, and violence.
